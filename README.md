# Attendance-Processing-App
Processes and cleans data from csv files to produce an output file showing the attendance computed for each student sorted alphabetically

Created a shell script that given a directory, recursively searches for CSV files that follows a certain naming convention, collects useful information from all these files and builds a consolidated CSV file

Developed a C program that takes as input the output file of the shell script and computes the attendance associated with each student by extracting data from each line and storing it inside a Node of a Linked List

Maintained the Linked List in an order of email ids to produce an output attendance file that is sorted alphabetically

Implemented modular programming and therefore created separate C files, header file and a makefile
